**Global health and climate benefits from walking and cycling infrastructure**

This code supports the analysis in Millard-Ball, A et al. (2025), *Global health and climate benefits from walking and cycling infrastructure* [citation will be updated when published].

For requirements, see `environment.yml`, which will set up an environment using conda.

The `.ipynb` notebook files run the analysis. The `stan_specification` directory specifies the Bayesian hierarchical model (`beta.stan`) and the alternative models used for robustness checks.
